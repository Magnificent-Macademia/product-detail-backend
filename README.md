# HackReactor - System Design Capstone

This is an application that was developed as a group for the HackReactor back-end system design capstone project. The main project objective was to develop a back-end application and api with product information for an e-commerce style product page. Each member was tasked to come up with server and database for their chosen section based on front-end project that was developed previously by other group of HR Courageous Cottonwood.

This repo is for Product Detail and Related Sections.

## Technology

The project was build using expressJS Server  and PostgreSQL for database implementation.  Completed application was deployed to an AWS Ubuntu EC2 server and AWS Ubuntu EC2 database.
Stress tested locally with k6 and once deployed with Loader io and New Relic.

## Contributions

**Technical Walkthrough and Challenges:**

- Setting up configuration of overlapping technologies
- Choosing the right database for needs of the project
- Getting familiar with new stress testing technologies and their configuration
- Formatting output data for use in Front-End project.
